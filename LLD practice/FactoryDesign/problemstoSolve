ðŸ§© Beginner Problems
1. Burger Shop (what youâ€™ve done)

    Create different types of burgers using a BurgerFactory.

    Extend it to add VeganBurger, KidsBurger, etc.

    âœ… Youâ€™ve already done the core â€” now try extending.

2. Notification Sender

Problem:
Create a system that can send notifications via:

    Email

    SMS

    Push Notification

Design:

    Interface: Notification

    Subclasses: EmailNotification, SMSNotification, PushNotification

    NotificationFactory::createNotification(string type)

3. Shape Drawer

Problem:
Given a shape name ("circle", "square", "triangle"), return a shape object that can draw itself.

Design:

    Interface: Shape { draw() }

    Subclasses: Circle, Square, Triangle

    ShapeFactory::createShape(string type)

ðŸ›  Intermediate Problems
4. Vehicle Manufacturing System

Problem:
Build a factory that produces different vehicles:

    Car

    Bike

    Truck

Design:

    Interface: Vehicle { drive() }

    Factory: VehicleFactory::createVehicle(string type)

Then extend it:

    Add LuxuryCar, ElectricBike, DeliveryTruck.

5. OS Widget Factory (Cross-platform UI)

Problem:
You want to render UI components (Button, Checkbox, TextField) for different platforms:

    Windows

    Mac

    Linux

Design:

    Abstract UI Elements: Button, Checkbox

    Concrete Versions: WindowsButton, MacButton, etc.

    Factory: UIFactory::createButton("windows")

This leads to Abstract Factory, a superset of Factory Pattern.

6. Payment Gateway Integration

Problem:
Build a payment processing system that can handle:

    PayPal

    Stripe

    Razorpay

Design:

    Interface: PaymentGateway { processPayment(amount) }

    Factory: PaymentFactory::getGateway("paypal")

Add runtime config-based gateway selection.
7. Document Parser

Problem:
Parse different file formats:

    JSON

    XML

    CSV

Design:

    Interface: Parser { parse(string content) }

    Factory: ParserFactory::getParser("json")

Inject into a FileProcessor class.
